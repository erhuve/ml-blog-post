    <h1>Arriving at Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
      Machine learning has been quite the buzz recently, from wielding the power
      of big data to optimize delivery routes, serve the best ads, or analyze
      medical imagery, to the ability to
      <a

        >beat the best humans at chess</a
      >,
      <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/"
        >generate lifelike images based on text prompts</a
      >, and even <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">write code</a>.
      With such recent innovations, there is even buzz of artificial
      intelligence taking over the jobs of artists and writers, things
      universally regarded as very human activities. And though I personally am
      quite skeptical of such a future, machine learning does draw inspiration
      from humans and the human mind. But it’s a little more complicated than
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Engineers often take inspiration from nature when first designing the
      things they build. For instance, many of our first attempts, or
      imaginations at flight began with feathered wings, like the birds we see
      in the sky.<br />

    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, we draw inspiration from none other than ourselves to build a
      machine that can learn. Again, it’s not so simple though.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s go back to the birds. Obviously, we can fly now. But we don’t do it
      with feathers. That would be ridiculous.
    </p>
    <img

      alt="an image of a plane with feathers on its wings, generated by DALL-E mini"
    />
    <p class="caption"><em>Generated by DALL-E mini by craiyon.com</em></p>
    <p>
      We do use wings though! But the basic idea is that we don’t need to
      perfectly replicate what we see in nature to accomplish our goals, and in
      fact an exact replica would probably never work in most cases. That’s
      because our tools of <em>implementation</em> are different.
    </p>

    <p>
      David Marr was a neuroscientist largely concerned with visual processing.
      He laid out three levels of analysis to understand vision, which can be
      extended to much more (like understanding the mind!). There is the
      computational level, concerned with what a system does, what it
      accomplishes and why. Then there’s the algorithmic level, concerned with
      the how, what processes it goes through. Finally there’s the
      implementation level, or the physical level. This is the physical
      realization of the computational and algorithmic levels. And it is
      probably the least important level to emulate when we build things
      inspired by nature (unless you are focused on it for some other purposes,
      like art, which is lovely). That’s because the physical implementations of
      things are so different and so unique, that it would be silly to limit
      ourselves to it. Again, feathers.

    </p>
    <p>
      But if we can thoroughly understand the computational and algorithmic
      levels, we can apply those to any implementation we see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to the brain, we’ve become pretty familiar with it on the
      physical level. Indeed, we’ve come a long way from 335 BC, when Aristotle
      thought the brain was a radiator keeping our hearts from overheating. Now
      we have an understanding of neurons, synapses, even the electric signaling
      processes of the brain. We can apply our knowledge of the brain’s
      architecture, memory, modularity and attention to machine learning, as we
      have for neural networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      How wonderful would it be if we could know more on the computational and
      algorithmic levels? While we can examine and measure the physical, mental
      properties– consciousness, intentionality, the thoughts behind the
      curtain– are private information, a black box.

    <p>
      The quest to understand the mind has plagued us for centuries, millenia.
      While we could make strides in machine learning thanks to our ability to
      analyze the brain (the physical), and even some computational and
      algorithmic understanding, there is so much more to it. To those who worry
      of AI making artists obsolete: as cliched as it sounds, AI will not
      replace you, because it is missing the elements, the essence that make us
      human. DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, GPT-3, and other machine learning models
      certainly are impressive and can produce incredible results. But do they
      have the same private elements of the human mind that have brought our
      species so far in the world?

    <p><em>Can</em> they?</p>
